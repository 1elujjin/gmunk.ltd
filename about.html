                <p>Sophiestication Software is a small software design and development company, which is run by Sophia Teutschler, one of those rare female developers. Sophia loves to create simple, yet easy to use human interfaces by striving to achieve the perfect balance between form and function.</p>
                <p>The company was founded back in spring 2005 to give Sophia an outlet for her ideas. Quickly over time it became a professional business which allowed her to put all of her time and effort into making great apps.</p>

                <p>Sophia was born in germany, and apparently, has no time to write a full bio about her life…</p>
                <p>Nowadays, Sophia can be spotted around Spires, usually with a Chai Tea Latte in her hands. If not found in the real world, she usually wastes her time on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081211033107/http://twitter.com/sophiestication/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081211033107/http://www.flickr.com/photos/sophiateutschler/">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081211033107/http://www.lastfm.com/user/sophie81de/">Last.fm</a>.</p>
